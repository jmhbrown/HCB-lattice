\title{Non-Interacting Bosons on an Optical Lattice Subject to a  Time-Dependent Potential}
\author{Jennifer Brown}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We extend techniques used to measure observables on a system of non-interacted bosons under a time-independednt trapping potential to the case of a time-dependent potential. 
This is accomplished by approximating the system's hamiltonian as a combination of its time-independent non-diagonal kinetic and time-dependent diagonal parts using a trotter approximation.
