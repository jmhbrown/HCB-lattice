\begin{abstract}
We extend techniques used to measure observables on a system of non-interacted bosons under a time-independednt trapping potential to the case of a time-dependent potential. 
This is accomplished by approximating the system's hamiltonian as a combination of its time-independent non-diagonal kinetic and time-dependent diagonal parts using a Trotter approximation.

\section{Introduction}
%\par Bose-Einstein condensates are an exotic state of matter achieved by some bosonic gases at temperatures approaching absolute zero. Confining these condensates to a lattice and subjecting them to a trapping potential is a powerful method for controlling their behavior on a fine-grain level. These optical lattices provide a tool for exploring fundamental issues in condensed matter physics and allow physicsts to simulate more complicated systems.
\par Existing methods for measuring observable quantities on bose-einstein condenstates are computational expensive when we impliment them for systems with time-dependent hamiltonians. This prohibitive computational cost comes from the need to re-diagonalize the hamiltonian at each time step. In this paper we propose a solution which uses a Trotter approximation to efficiently factor a hamiltonian into it's time-dependent diagonal and time-independent off-diagonal components.
