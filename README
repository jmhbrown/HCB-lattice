## Brief Description
			Contains code for working with Hard Core Bosons on a lattice.
			Adapted from Kai He's version, which was adapted from Marcos Rigol's version.


## Compiling
			The code in 'Dynamic Source' includes a makefile which I haven't tried, but used to work.
			The code in 'Dynamic Working' is a WIP and probably won't compile easily.
